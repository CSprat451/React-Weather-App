# React Weather App

## Overview

This project is a Weather App created using React. The app displays weather information provided by the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Requirements / Technology

- React
- API key from openweathermap.org

## Features

- Get the current weather data from any city
- The background changes based on the weather conditions
- Can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit

## Setup

Set up a .env file with your API key from openweathermap.org.
According to the React App docs, the .env file should look like the following:

API Key:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
`

Base URL:

`
REACT_APP_API_URL = "base_url"
`

The API key and the base URL will be provided by openweathermap.org.

To run the React App, open the project directory in the command line and run `npm start`.
This will open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Status

This project is complete. I may add one or two more features in the future as I continue to learn React.

## Inspiration

This Weather App was partially inspired by the Build a Weather App in React JS | React JS beginner Tutorial by Tyler Potts.
